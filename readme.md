# 3d printable enclosure for https://github.com/okyeron/neotrellis-monome/

*Warning!!* Because this enclosure is printed in two parts, it will not have the stiffness or stability of a laser cut enclosure. I'm providing these files for folks that have easy access to a 3d printer.

## Assembly notes

- place inserts in the outer 4 holes of each faceplate half
- the dovetail in the center may be a bit tricky to push together if your printers tolerances are loose. Try filing down one side or the other to give you some wiggle room
